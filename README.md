2020 - Intro to AI Project 2, assignment details linked [here](https://bhrolenok.github.io/teaching/cs-3600-spr2020/project2/index.html)

This project taught me about Markov Decision Processes, Value/Policy iteration along with the basics of Q-Learning, by creating an agent for the well known pacman game, such that the agent both understood the reward of food, and the punishment of being consumed by a ghost.

Commited late to avoid 3 day late period shenanigans
